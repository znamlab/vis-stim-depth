# vis-stim-depth
Codes for visual stimulation for depth mapping
Local domain name: sphere
18/12/20 @yiranhe: Bonsai codes for creating multiple spheres with varying XYZ positions & updates perspective view according to wheel position
21/12/20 @yiranhe: Fixed delay problem; Spheres continuously appear; Random sampling.
                   Problems: 1) front spheres block back ones (set transparency??)
                             2) get rid of the middle sphere
                             3) XY to elevation/azimuth
                             4) same angular size for all depth!!
                             5) simplify & tidy up the workflow
