This script has 3 main sections:
1) Takes video input from a Basler camera, which needs to be previously configured using the Pylon software.
   It then buffers and averages the video, and saves each frame as individual tiffs,
   in the folder specified in Saving Dir. Additionally, a mean of the FOV is computed and saved. 
   Furthermore, time-stamps of the raw and buffered video are saved for controls.

2) Takes 2 analog inputs via a USB NI-DAQ, and saves them: 
   a) PhotoDiode 
   b) Frame clock from the Basler camera (called Exp.Active)
   In addition, it uses the PhotoDiode signal to make a live count of stimuli, useful during the experiment

3) Generates the visual stimulus. The generation of the stim is done in the node: "GratingStim". 
   For more info on how it is generated, refer to the documentation on the bonVision website: 
   https://bonvision.github.io/pages/001_info/
   Importantly, the randomization of the stimulus position is not done within bonsai.
   Instead, a random sequence of the x and y positions fo the stimulus is generated externally 
   (I use Matlab), stored in a csv, and then read in at the beginning of the stimulation.
   X and Y positions are also saved again by Bonsai in this section.
